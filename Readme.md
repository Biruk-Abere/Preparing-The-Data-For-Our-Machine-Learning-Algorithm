# DataPreProcessing Before Feeding To Our Machine Learning Algorithm
- These Project Includes:-
			1) Importing The Data
			2) Taking A Quick Look To The DataStructure
			3) Looking For Corelations between the datas
			4) Cleaning The Data includes
							a) Dealing With Empty Datas
							b) Dealing With Duplicated Datas
							c) Dealing With Outliers
			5) Handling Text and Categorical Attributes
							a) OrdinalEncoder
							b) OneHotEncoder
			6) Feature Scaling
					  a) MinMax Scaler(Normalizaation)
					  b) Z-score Normalization (Standardization) 
- We Used Scikit-Learn For Building and Scaling Purpose 
- We Used The Book Hands On Machine Learning As Our Refrence
